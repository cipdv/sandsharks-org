        We follow the FIVB beach volleyball rules: https://www.fivb.com/en/beachvolleyball/thegame_bvb_glossary/officialrulesofthegames. However, there are no refs to make the tough calls so we’re not too stingy on “doubles,” and if there is any disagreement on a call, raise both thumbs and ask to reserve the ball. In general, we discourage receiving serves and shots with an overhead hand pass, unless the ball is hit at you and there is no other way to pass the ball. The goal of these games is for everyone to have a fun time; the scores and winning the games are irrelevant. If you’re new to volleyball, don’t worry, we’ll help you learn the rules and you’ll pick it up soon enough. 

Here’s a great video that explains all the unique rules of 2v2 beach volleyball: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzO7EvB7mDE 

We do have one unique rule to encourage everyone to interact with different people: every game should be played with a different partner. Try to play with as many different people around your skill level as you can throughout the day, and invite newcomers to join you to help them feel welcome.
