          stingy on “doubles,” and if there is any disagreement on a call, raise
          both thumbs and ask to reserve the ball. In general, we discourage
          receiving serves and shots with an overhead hand pass, unless the ball
          is hit at you and there is no other way to pass the ball.

          scores and winning the games are irrelevant. If you’re new to

          <b>every game should be played with a different partner</b>. Try to
